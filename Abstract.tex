\section{Abstract}

Recent years have seen the maturing of the cloud streaming and \acrfull{vr} space. Now that these technologies are mature enough by themselves, first endevours in cloud VR streaming have been made, but the combination of these technologies is still in its infancy.

Motivated by this Saxion and the \acrfull{irh} want to investigate the feasibility of this technology for use-cases inside of the \acrshort{irh}. To achieve this goal they created a multi-phase project, of which this paper is the first phase, aiming to explore the current state of technology and research and using these results to support the later phases of the project. To this end the research question is as follows: "\textit{\input{ResearchQuestionsMain}}"

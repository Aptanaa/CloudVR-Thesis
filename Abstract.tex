\section{Abstract}

The graduations goal was to find out: "\textit{\input{ResearchQuestionsMain}}". \\

The chosen technology stack is NVIDIA's CloudXR SDK deployed on an Microsoft Azure Server, since it was the only feasible way to provide a working prototype for the client within the project time-frame. The report includes the necessary theoretical knowledge, the decision making progress behind the prototype, implementation and testing of the prototype and implications of the results of the tests. The prototype in it's final set up had an individual frame latency that was only 1-2 \acrshort{ms} higher than the researched barrier of 20\acrshort{ms} and fulfilled security demands.

\section{Conclusion}

This project aimed to identify "\textit{\input{ResearchQuestionsMain}}". Based on the experiments done it can be concluded that NVIDIA's Cloud XR software \parencite{cloudxr} is the only viable technology stack that can meet those requirements. It possesses only marginally higher individual frame latency than the much discussed \hyperref[sec:theo]{20\acrshort{ms} \acrshort{mtp} threshold } and runs in a secure cloud. The high performance means that user experience is barely impacted. Furthermore the software works with the OpenVR SDK, which is by far the most popular choice for \acrshort{vr} applications, so there are no added difficulties to developing applications on this technology stack.
\\ \\
To better understand the limitations of the system, practitioners should consider to test the application with scenes of increasing polygon complexity to determine the maximum amount of polygons a cloud \acrshort{vr} scene can have before performance degrades.

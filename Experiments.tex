\section{Experiments}

After about a month of researching for existing solutions, applying for NVIDIA CloudXR and quickly testing the difficulty of different prototype architectures it became clear that making a prototype is not a feasible task for the duration and team size of the project. This conclusion is based on two major observations:

\paragraph{NVIDIA CloudXR SDK is the only working solution}
During the research a couple of existing products were found, that demonstrated the feasibility of key areas of interest for this project: Low Latency, High Security. \parencite{gtc2020esi}. All of the products found were launched during or shortly before the start of the graduation, so it is safe to say that the technology is emerging. Another overlap of these products was that they all used NVIDIA's CloudXR SDK to enable them to stream \acrshort{vr} content. In the conference talks, where these products were presented, CloudXR was always mentioned as the last piece of the puzzle to enable the creation of ambitions cloud \acrshort{vr} projects.

\paragraph{Making a custom Prototype will not provide any benefits}
When experimenting with the \hyperref[fig:pr11]{first} and \hyperref[fig:pr12]{second} prototype design, both in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 3D, it was possible to quickly create a WebRTC connection from a 'server' machine to a 'client' machine in the same network. However before I ever got to implementing the whole application loop it was already evident that the performance would be a critical factor. As explored in the \nameref{sec:theo} the \acrfull{mtp} is not allowed exceed 20\acrshort{ms}, where as the latency in the prototypes would be atleast around 100\acrshort{ms} normally. This was measured in a local network setup instead of a cloud server and without streaming the significantly bigger VR resolution of 2160x1200, all of which things that would have impacted the latency negatively even more. Considering this it would be impossible to create and optimize a prototype to undercut the \acrshort{mtp} barrier. Additionally it became clear alternative solutions like ReactVR \parencite{reactVR} and A-Frame \parencite{aframe} were not suitable for the use-cases of the stakeholders, as they do not allow for the complexity needed as discussed in the \nameref{sec:int}.

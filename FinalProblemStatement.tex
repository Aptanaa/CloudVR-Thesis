\section{Final Problem Statement}

As explored in the Theoretical Framework there are many existing products/technologies for all the individual parts of a cloud \acrshort{vr} system. With this knowledge, the product will consist out of several pre-made components that are going to be combined to create a working prototype. Since there are already products on the market that prove the feasibility of creating a working solution by utilizing these technology components \parencite{zerolight5g}, there is no need to develop novel technology. Thus the focus of this report shifts to finding the technology stack that benefits the stakeholders the most.

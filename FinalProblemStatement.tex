\section{Final Problem Statement}
\label{sec:fps}

As explored in the Theoretical Framework there are many existing products/technologies for the individual parts of a cloud \acrshort{vr} system. With this knowledge, the product will consist out of several pre-made components that are going to be combined to create a working prototype. There is already a product on the market that proves the feasibility of creating a product with cloud \acrshort{vr} \parencite{zerolight5g}, but it uses a propritary solution \parencite{cloudxr}. At the time of this research there are no complete solutions that are open sourced, but the vast majority of technologies used in the proprietary solution are open source themselves. Keeping this in mind, the problem statement of this report shifts towards finding the correct combination of available technology to satisfy the latency and security demands of the clients. The main problem is that the clients do not know which technology stacks work in practice.

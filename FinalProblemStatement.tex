\section{Final Problem Statement}

As explored in the Theoretical Framework there are many existing products/technologies for all the individual parts of a cloud \acrshort{vr} system. With this knowledge, the product will consist out of several pre-made components that are going to be combined to create a working prototype. Since there are already products on the market that prove the feasibility of creating a working solution by utilizing these technology components \parencite{zerolight5g}, there is no need to develop novel technology. Keeping this in mind, the problem statement of this report shifts towards finding the correct combination of available technology to satisfy the latency and security demands of the clients. The main problem is that the clients do not know which technology stacks work in practice. To identify if a tech stack satisfies the requirements, a prototype of the proposed stack will be created and subsequently compared to a "traditional (local)" solution to measure the effectiveness of the prototype in terms of \acrshort{qoe} and latency.

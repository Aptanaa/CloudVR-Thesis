\section{Final Problem Statement}

As explored in the Theoretical Framework there are many existing products/technologies for all the individual parts of a cloud \acrshort{vr} system. With this knowledge, the product will consist out of several pre-made components that are going to be combined to create a working prototype. Since there is not really a need to develop novel technology the problem shifts from "Can a cloud vr system be built?" to "Which combination of components best satisfies the clients needs?".

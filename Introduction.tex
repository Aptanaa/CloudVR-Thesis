\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:int}
Recent developments in the field of \acrfull{vr} offer all kinds of opportunities in the field of training
and entertainment. For training purposes, the audiovisual entry into a virtual world is where the biggest value is.
The capabilities of artificial environments allow users to manage scenarios and 
experiences that cannot be simulated in the real world. \acrshort{vr} also allows users to access the virtual training at any time
and less physical facilities are required for exercises. 
Example \acrshort{vr} experiences include training maintenance at high altitudes (such as windmills), working under heavy loads and weather conditions in construction (Strukton) or maintenance on high-tech naval radar ships (Thales). These companies (and more) form the \acrfull{irh}, which is one of the stakeholders of this project. The \acrshort{irh} is an industry consortium of 17 partners in AR/VR - The European digital innovation hub for industrial applied Augmented and Virtual Reality, stimulating cooperation and innovation between companies, government and knowledge institutes, resulting in world class business, knowledge and facilities. The hub is the AR/VR Field lab in the Dutch Smart Industry program and is recognized by the European commission as Digital Innovation Hub for industrial AR/VR \parencite{irh}. Lastly I want to mention that this project was conducted during the 2020 corona virus pandemic and as such, user testing was limited.

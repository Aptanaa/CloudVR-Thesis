\section{Introduction}
Recent developments in the field of virtual reality (VR) offer all kinds of opportunities in the field of training
and entertainment. For training purposes, the audiovisual entry into a virtual world is where the biggest value is.
The capabilities of artificial environments allow users to manage scenarios and 
experiences that cannot be simulated in the real world. VR also allows users to access the virtual training at any time
and less physical facilities are required for exercises. 
Examples VR experiences include training maintenance at high altitudes (such as windmills), working under heavy loads
weather conditions in construction (Strukton) or maintenance on naval ships (Thales).

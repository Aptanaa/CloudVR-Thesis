\subsection{Modern ($<$5 years old) research and technology}

Within the last decade the cloud computing space has expanded rapidly and with it the possibilities. Today, even individuals can set up an experimental cloud VR streaming solution from pre-made components \parencite{tayoexe}, such as the service from cloud computing company Shadow \parencite{shadow}. The most recent years have also seen the rise of commercial cloud streaming for gaming services, such as Google Stadia \parencite{stadia}, XBox XCloud \parencite{xcloud} and Nvidia GeForceNow \parencite{geforcenow}, but not without problems, as the services were quickly overwhelmed on launch. However no commercial products for cloud VR streaming exist at the time of writing, hence the need for this research paper.

Research Papers like the ones from \cite{cutcord} or from \cite{mvr} demonstrate the viability and technical feasibility of cloud VR streaming . They developed innovative solutions to achieve and undercut the 20ms Motion-to-Photon (MTP) barrier while streaming VR content. 20ms is the agreed upon threshold a frame should have, from receiving the input to displaying the frame on the Head Mounted Display (HMD), to avoid inducing motion sickness. One such solution is a low latency control loop that streams VR scenes containing only the userâ€™s Field of View (FoV) and a latency adaptive margin area around the FoV. This allows the clients to render locally at a high refresh rate to accommodate and compensate for the head movements before the next motion update arrives. \parencite{mvr}. Another angle of attack  leverage's the power of parallel rendering, encoding, transmission and decoding, together with a Remote VSync Driven Rendering approach to minimize MTP latency \parencite{cutcord}. The prototype for this experiment was based on commodity hardware, which further demonstrates the feasability of cloud VR streaming.

2010-2015 a lot of crucial standards were developed, that are being used today to power cutting edge cloud solutions.

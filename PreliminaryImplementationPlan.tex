\input{Introduction}
\section{Reason for Assignment}
\subsection{Graduation Assignment}
The assignment for this graduation is to analyse the current state of cloud \acrshort{vr} streaming. This includes existing commercial services, open source libraries/frameworks, relevant research papers and experimental technologies. The 4 research directions for this project are system architecture for a cloud \acrshort{vr} system, Latency, Multi-User Experiences and \acrshort{gpu} Scaling. This paper will focus on researching the system architecture and latency improvements. These findings will be presented in the form of a theoretical framework and a literature review.

Armed with the information from the initial part of the research, the student and the stakeholders will agree on a suitable research focus for the reminder of the project.
\subsection{Client outline}
The stakeholders in this project are the student (Leon Koster), Saxion's XR Lab (Matthijs van Veen, Yiwei Jiang) and the Industrial Reality Hub (Thales \& more).
\section{Objectives of the client}
Together with the companies from the Industrial Reality Hub mentioned in the Client outline, Saxion wants to investigate how virtual reality can be rendered in the cloud in a safe and efficient manner. This involves looking at state-of-
the art technology in the field of virtual reality, cloud computing, rendering and machine learning for one
complete Cloud\acrshort{vr} pipeline. 

In the bigger picture this project is a multi phase project, with this project being the initial phase. It aims to give an overview of the current situation regarding cloud \acrshort{vr} streaming and focus on system architecture and latency optimization. These informations will subsequently be utilized in the later stages of the over arching research project.

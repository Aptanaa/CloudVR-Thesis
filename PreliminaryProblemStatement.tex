\section{Preliminary Problem Statement}
One of the essentials for a good VR experience is a powerful computer system to render semi-realistic
worlds. However, there are two problems here. First, this type of system is not available in every location.
Certainly if realistic images have to be rendered in the simulation, it requires specialized and expensive machines that are difficult to move. 

The second problem is that for rendering the VR training scenario, all kinds of data about the scenarios need to be available on the system. 
This can pose a problem when it concerns sensitive information, for example about all kinds of information
defense systems or business sensitive information.

Focusing on these problems will lay the foundation for future research, to make CloudVR streaming a mature technology.

The aim of this project is to investigate the feasability of a streaming based VR approach with current cutting edge technology.
Qualitative research methods will be used to gain in-depth insights about existing solutions and the current state of research into this topic.
The data will be contextualized via a literature review of recent research papers and an analysis of the capabilites of existing solutions when applied to the research problem.

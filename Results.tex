\section{Results}
Below are the test results gathered from the setup described in the previous section.

\subsection{Test 1: End-to-End Latency}

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{End-to-End Latency (ms)}\\

\end{table}

Initial measurements show that the \acrshort{mtp} latency of the Cloud \acrshort{vr} prototype is about 87.5\% higher than a normal application on a local machine and about 50\% higher than a \acrshort{vr} application on a local machine.

\subsection{Test 2: Network Latency}
Testing with Wireshark \parencite{wireshark} revealed that the round trip delay for a single packet is \textbf{5-6 ms}. This is supported by data collected from the CXR \parencite{cloudxr} software, which measured similar results.

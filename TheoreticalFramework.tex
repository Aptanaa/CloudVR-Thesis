\section{Theoretical Framework}

In order to thoroughly understand the aim and subject of the research, it is important to explore different existing solutions and literature. Therefore, the subjects that will be discussed in the  following theoretical framework are Cloud Streaming/Cloud Computing and Virtual Reality. Within this theoretical framework, definitions of the subjects will be given as well as current insights into these subjects. The topics reflect knowledge needed to understand the problem space. Together all of the topics make up the 360 scan.

\subsection{Cloud Streaming/Cloud Computing}

\subsubsection{Definition}
According to Armbrust et al. (2010) Cloud computing is defined as follows: 
"Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the data centers that provide those services." \parencite[]{aviewoncc}
We can then further define Cloud streaming as the applications that are delivered over the internet as a service.

\subsubsection{Existing Solutions and Technology}
Several commercial gaming Cloud streaming services already exist, such as Google Stadia \parencite{stadia}, XBox XCloud \parencite{xcloud} and Nvidia GeForceNow \parencite{geforcenow}. The start of 2020 also saw the first experimental cloud acrshort{vr} streaming development kits, such as Nvidia's CloudXR \parencite{cloudxr}. There is also a variety of Infrastructure\hyp{}as\hyp{}a\hyp{}service (IaaS) platforms, such as Amazon's AWS \parencite{aws}, Microsoft's Azure \parencite{azure} and Google's Cloud Platform \parencite{gcp}. For more information about these applications and technologies, please refer to the \hyperref[sec:lit]{Literature Analysis}.

\subsection{Virtual Reality}

\subsubsection{Definition}
Early works, such as the 1996 article "Virtual Reality in Scientific Visualizations"  or the 2003 book "Virtual Reality Technology", define Virtual Reality as: "The use of computers and human\hyp{}computer interfaces to create the effect of a three\hyp{}dimensional world containing interactive objects with a strong sense of three\hyp{}dimensional presence."\parencite{vrsv} or "A Simulation in which computer graphics is used to create a realistic looking world. Moreover, the synthetic world is not static, but responds to the users input. This defines a key feature of Virtual Reality, \textit{real\hyp{}time interactivity}" \parencite{vrtech}.

\subsubsection{Physical Constraints}

As mentioned before, when developing a \acrshort{vr} application, there are a few physical constraints that developers need to be aware of. The most important threshold to know is the 20 \acrshort{ms} \acrfull{mtp} delay. Upon input from the \acrfull{hmd}, the developer has to display a new rendered image within an average of 20 \acrshort{ms} to avoid motion sickness for users. The more this threshold can be undercut, the better the chances to have an acceptable gameplay experience without motion sickness. Interaction input, such as the input from the controllers, can safely be processed at delays of $>$100 \acrshort{ms} without any negative repercussions in terms of \acrfull{ux}.
